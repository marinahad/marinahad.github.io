				<h1> Track and field</h1>
				<h3> Sprint event </h3>
				<p> The 100-meter sprint is an exciting event. One of the truest forms of human competition, sprinters must run in a straight line as fast as possible. The winner of the 100-meter sprint is the first runner to cross the finish line.</p>
				<h3>Sprinting rules</h3>
				<p>Here are some of the most important sprinting rules</p>
				<ul>
					<li> As the athletes get ready to start the competition they need to make sure that they have not taken any supplements to increase the speed and stamina. But, if they are found guilty they are disqualified under the grounds of unfair mean practices.</li>
					<li> The athletes cannot touch the starting line or the other side of the starting side line before the pistol fires.</li>
					<li> Sensors are placed in the starting pistol and at the starting blocks. In case of a false start the athlete is disqualified.</li>
					<li>Once the sprinters start to run, they need to make sure that they do not step on the white lines that mark the lanes throughout the race.</li>
					<li>Sprinters should run in their designated lanes and cannot cross the lanes throughout the race.</li>
					<li>Athletes cannot obstruct each otherâ€™s path or else they will get disqualified.</li>
					<li>Athletes should not leave the track but if they do so they cannot come back on the track. This leads to disqualification.</li>
					<li>The athletes are advised to have only up to eleven spikes or less as per their needs but if they have more than eleven spikes then they will be disqualified.</li>
					<li>The spikes size cannot exceed more than nine mm.</li>
