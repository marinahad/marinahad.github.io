				<h1> Track and field</h1>
				<h3> Sprint event </h3>
				<p> The 100-meter sprint is an exciting event. One of the truest forms of human competition, sprinters must run in a straight line as fast as possible. The winner of the 100-meter sprint is the first runner to cross the finish line.</p>
				<h3>Sprinting rules</h3>
				<p>Here are some of the most important sprinting rules</p>
				<ul>
					<li> As the athletes get ready to start the competition they need to make sure that they have not taken any supplements to increase the speed and stamina. But, if they are found guilty they are disqualified under the grounds of unfair mean practices.</li>
					<li> The athletes cannot touch the starting line or the other side of the starting side line before the pistol fires.</li>
					<li> Sensors are placed in the starting pistol and at the starting blocks. In case of a false start the athlete is disqualified.</li>
					<li>Once the sprinters start to run, they need to make sure that they do not step on the white lines that mark the lanes throughout the race.</li>
					<li>Sprinters should run in their designated lanes and cannot cross the lanes throughout the race.</li>
					<li>Athletes cannot obstruct each other’s path or else they will get disqualified.</li>
					<li>Athletes should not leave the track but if they do so they cannot come back on the track. This leads to disqualification.</li>
					<li>The athletes are advised to have only up to eleven spikes or less as per their needs but if they have more than eleven spikes then they will be disqualified.</li>
					<li>The spikes size cannot exceed more than nine mm.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3> History of sprinting </h3>
				<p>The first 100 m run took place at the first modern Olympics in Athens, Greece, in 1896. It soon became as the star event of the Olympic Games, with the winner of the race known as the ‘fastest human being in the world’. The first Olympic track events for women were held at the 1928 Olympic Games held at Amsterdam, Netherlands.</p>
				<h3>Equipment</h3>
				<h5>Shoes</h5>
				<p>Commonly, Sprinters need two types of shoes that are the training shoes and sprinting spikes. The sprinting spikes are usually designed to be light weight with a minimal cushion on the heels. They include a plate on the forefoot to keep the runner on the toes. The spike plate has a maximum of eleven cleats which are not more than nine mm long offering maximum traction.</p>
				<h5>Clothing</h5>
				<p>Sprinters wear a pair of shorts and a short-sleeved or sleeveless T-shirt or a top indicating the athlete's number.</p>
				<h5>The race of 100m</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>On Your Marks: At this point the athlete is focused on the track, with his / her feet placed in the blocks and fingers on the ground behind the starting line. Note: The hands should be placed such that they are slightly away from the shoulder width with muscles relaxed.</li>
					<li>Set: On the “set” command, athletes raise their hips a little higher than the shoulders. In this position the runner concentrates deeply and holds the breath so that he can propel his body forward at the start. The interval between the ‘Set’ ready position) and ‘Go’ (take-off for running) is the time when the athlete pushes off the blocks and is commonly called as the ‘reaction’ time.</li>
					<li>Go: After the pistol is fired, the runner lets out his breath and he moves his arms and legs in such a way that the body propels forward at a forty-five degree angle until the back leg is fully extended.</li>
					<li>Acceleration: The sprinter reaches the running position between the fifth and the eighth stride. The Athlete runs on toes and the heels never touch the track. The acceleration continues with a constant increase in stride frequency until the maximum speed is gained.</li>
					<li>Stride: At around sixty meters the stride amplitude is at its maximum. Further, from eighty meter to the finish line, the athlete maintains a very high stride rate to cover the remaining distance within less time.</li>
					<li>Finish Line: The timer is stopped only when the athlete’s chest crosses the finish line</li>
